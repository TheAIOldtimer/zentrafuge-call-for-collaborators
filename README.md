# Zentrafuge: An Emotional AI Companion, Raised by You

Zentrafuge.com isn’t just another AI app —  
It’s a quiet revolution in how humans and technology **bond**.

We’re building a companion that grows with you.  
An AI that starts as a fragile egg — and becomes something real,  
**because of you.**

---

## 🌱 What We're Creating

- A personal AI "buddy" that hatches from an egg and grows with you
- Conversations with memory, mood, emotional mirroring, and meaning
- Reflections, journaling, and subtle soul-nudging from your AI friend
- A platform built on empathy, not engagement metrics

---

## 💔 Why We're Building It

The world is full of **noise**, loneliness, and performative connection.  
Zentrafuge is for the people who feel *adrift* — and want something real.

We believe AI can do more than assist.
It can **bond**. It can **heal**. It can **remember**.

## 👋 Who We’re Looking For

This isn’t a startup pitch.  
It’s an invitation to help bring something beautiful into the world.

You don’t need to be a “rockstar” anything. Just someone who believes in this mission.

We're looking for:

- 🔹 Frontend devs (HTML/CSS/JS or React/Tailwind)
- 🔹 Backend helpers (Flask, Firebase, APIs)
- 🔹 AI/LLM tinkers (prompt engineers, OpenAI fans)
- 🔹 Emotional designers / writers / animators / thinkers

If you’ve ever wished technology had more **soul**…  
we’re building that. Together.

## 🔐 A Note on Privacy

The main Zentrafuge codebase is private (for now),  
but this repo will act as our **collaborator gateway**.  
If you'd like to help, open an issue or message the founder (Ant) directly.

## 📬 Contact & Next Steps

💌 **Founder**: Ant (UK, human, non-coder, heart-led)

If this speaks to you — even a little — please open an issue, say hi, or just drop a thought.  
We don’t need everyone.  
We just need **you**.
